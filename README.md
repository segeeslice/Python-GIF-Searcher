## A bit of background...

I wrote this for my final project in my Python Programming class at the University of Cincinnati. With the one semester of knowledge under our belt, we were tasked with creating pretty much *anything* in Python. It was a free reign project, with many people resorting to simple tasks like sorting algorithms.

I wanted to push myself a little.

Using the GIPHY API and Tkinter graphic tools, I challenged myself to make an application that can allow for lightweight searching and downloading of online GIFs. Unfortunately, the Tkinter package does not have much support for animations, so I had to custom layer images on top of each other at a specific rate to simulate the animation. It worked, but at the cost of a severely increased GIF processing time prior to the first animation start. Inevitably, I do not think it fit the goal, and probably couldn't have been lightweight without changing the GUI entirely.

As of the time of writing (10:49 July 21, 2018), I do not plan on touching this ever again. I pulled this over from my class assignment repo for reference on my main GitHub account in the future. I may overhaul it in the distant future to use a different GUI package, but I would rather touch other languages and projects first.

I learned a ton from doing this project, and hope any up-and-coming coders can use my source code to learn something as well. If you're not a coder and you happened to stumble upon this, then I hope you enjoy the product! In any case, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want a friend to talk to.


Have a great day,
